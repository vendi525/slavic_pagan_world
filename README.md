Slavic Pagan Calendar Project

A simple, focused landing page for a Slavic Pagan Calendar. This project aims to bring ancient traditions into a modern format, starting with a downloadable digital calendar and expanding into a comprehensive resource for Slavic mythology and folk traditions.
🚀 Current Features

    Visual Preview: High-quality image previews of the current month's calendar.

    Digital Download: One-click download options (PDF/PNG) for the full yearly calendar.

    Mobile Responsive: A clean, static landing page that works on phones and desktops.

🗺️ Roadmap

The project is currently a landing page, but I plan to expand it into a cultural hub:

    [ ] Myths & Legends: Dedicated articles for deities like Perun, Veles, and Mokosh.

    [ ] Festival Descriptions: Deep dives into the "Wheel of the Year" (Koliada, Kupala, etc.).

    [ ] Ritual Guides: Modern ways to celebrate traditional Slavic holidays.
